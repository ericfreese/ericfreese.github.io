title: Readable W3C Archives

I was sick of the lack of thread context on the [W3C archive pages](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/), so I made this little node app last weekend to scrape email data from the W3C pages and pretty it up a bit.

Source is available [here](https://github.com/ericfreese/w3mailparse). Demo [here](http://w3lists.herokuapp.com/).
